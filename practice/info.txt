These are all the practice problems I completed on the way to writing focal.
I am taking a Udemy course, and these coding challenges are helping me apply
linear algebra concepts in python. 

They are organized by chapter folders.

Ch1 & Ch2 are NOT missing. They were intro videos and setup videos, they did
not have any practice or challenges to be completed.
